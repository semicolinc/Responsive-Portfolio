                I'm a financial-computer science major at the Kelley School of Business with a love for new startups and emerging technologies. Ever in highschool, I have been working with friends to develop ideas that we found impactful. For an example, we developed a startup called Torch, whose goal is to break down language barriers through a real-time translation technology integrated with video chat systems. Now, I've been highly interested to get into the biotechnology industry as I think its the next 'age', beyond the rapid automation of work - improving the natural basic functions of humans.

                I have been helping out with research studies to gain experience, and focusing on developing key computer science-oriented skills to independently develop my own startups. My experience with leading startups makes me a good candidate for jobs that require creative planning and hard work, so if you have any positions where I may fit, contact me at: colinchang09@gmail.com.
